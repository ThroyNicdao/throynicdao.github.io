*Intrests: Things that intrest me and what I hope to accomplish in this course.*


I am interested in software engineering because it combines design, business, and ITâ€”three areas that excite me. I enjoy the creative side of designing software, especially how user interfaces and experiences can make an app easy and enjoyable to use. Good design is important for making software both functional and visually appealing. By improving my design skills, I hope to create better digital products that people find useful and engaging.  

I also want to get better at debugging and programming. Debugging is an important skill because it helps fix errors and improve the quality of software. I want to learn how to find and solve problems efficiently so that my code runs smoothly. Strengthening my programming skills will allow me to build more advanced applications and explore new technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.  

In the future, I hope to use these skills to start my own business. By combining software development with business knowledge, I can create and sell digital products, such as websites, apps, or online services. Learning more about IT infrastructure and security will also help me manage my business effectively. Overall, I want to continue improving my skills in design, debugging, and programming so that I can turn my ideas into successful software projects.
