As someone new to TypeScript, I have found it to be quite challenging, especially compared to Java and JavaScript. The syntax feels different and unfamiliar, making it difficult for me to understand and apply the concepts effectively. Unlike Java, which has a more rigid structure, or JavaScript, which is more flexible, TypeScript introduces static typing, which adds another layer of complexity. Because I do not have prior experience with TypeScript, I often find myself struggling with basic concepts and debugging errors that I do not fully understand. This learning curve has made my introduction to TypeScript frustrating and overwhelming.

In terms of its usefulness as a programming language, I am not yet sure if TypeScript is good or bad from a software engineering perspective. Some developers say that it helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability, but since I am still struggling with the basics, I have not yet experienced these benefits firsthand. Right now, it feels more like a barrier to writing code than a helpful tool. Perhaps with more practice and experience, I will be able to appreciate why many engineers prefer TypeScript over plain JavaScript. However, at this point in my learning journey, I find it more confusing than beneficial.

Athletic software engineering, particularly the practice WODs (Workouts of the Day), has been a very stressful experience for me. Since I already find coding difficult, having to complete timed exercises under pressure only adds to my frustration. I struggle to keep up with the pace and often feel discouraged when I cannot finish a task in the given time. While I understand that this method is meant to simulate real-world problem-solving. Instead of feeling motivated, I often feel overwhelmed and defeated. Im sure I will get better as time goes on though.
